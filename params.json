{"name":"FC_Polydart","tagline":"Point of Sale/Enterprise Suite Web App, built with Polymer and Dart","body":"### Welcome to our page!\r\nThis is an ambitious project, attempting to build a med-large scale enterprise suite and point of sale solution using relatively new technologies, namely Dart and Polymer. Dart is a Java/Javascript like language which can be run in vm or compiled to JS. Polymer is Google's take on Web Components. Our backend will be pure Dart/MySQL, leveraging several other open source Dart projects along the way. Our frontend will use Polymer.dart, compiled to JS for browser compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\nSome goals we have, in no particular order:\r\n* A NoSQL session store for tracking active users.\r\n* An RPC api supporting the Discovery Document format, so other frontends can conceivably be written.\r\n* A Polymer front end implementing the Material Design spec.\r\n* Encrypted traffic using RSA.\r\n* A powerful local api, to allow for non-web app front ends.\r\n* Full stack Dart (with frontend compiled to JS and vulcanized)\r\n* Inventory Tracking\r\n* Multiple location tracking\r\n* Customer Relationship Management\r\n* Invoicing\r\n* HR Management\r\n* Event scheduling\r\n* Shipment tracking\r\n* CC Processing\r\n* Bitcoin?\r\n* Touch screen friendly interface (frontend)\r\n* Android app (someday, Discovery Document format should help with porting)\r\n* Offline support where possible (This will be necessarily limited)\r\n* Free puppies for early adopters\r\n* Barcode label generation\r\n* A secretary to keep goal lists from getting out of hand\r\n\r\n### Leveraged Projects\r\nThere are several external projects we are using in our server-side code. Some are fresher than others, but we hope to be able to contribute some changes back, bringing the stale projects we're using back to life. The projects we are working with server-side include: [RPC](https://github.com/dart-lang/rpc), [Cipher](https://github.com/izaera/cipher) (Though soon to migrate to [PointyCastle](https://github.com/PointyCastle/pointycastle), which is actively maintained), [AvocadORM](https://github.com/magnetfruit/avocadorm), [uuid](https://github.com/Daegalus/dart-uuid), [redis_client](https://github.com/dartist/redis_client), [validator](https://github.com/karan/validator.dart), and a few more, indirectly. Some of these projects have been forked into my repo list for the purposes of rooting out bugs and making it all play nicely together. Once my main goals have been met (a functional app, for one), I plan to go back, clean up any changes I made, and open pull requests back where appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is a small project, currently made up of only 1 active developer, with 2 developers who occasionally assist in grinding out code. Design and Modeling by @SecareLupus.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact @SecareLupus if you have any questions, or open an issue on our tracker. Once application is finished, tested, polished, and production ready, we will be offering commercial support helping businesses get set up, organized, and implemented. We will also offer commercial support building custom modules to specialize FC to your company's needs.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
